## ðŸ¤– Inspiration
Mental health is often stigmatized in Asia due to cultural beliefs and social norms. In many Asian societies, mental illness is a taboo topic viewed as a personal weakness or failure, rather than a medical condition that requires treatment. There is a prevalent cultural perception that mental health problems are shameful and must be hidden from others, leading to a lack of understanding and support for those who are struggling. Many people in Asia are also hesitant to seek professional help for mental health issues due to fears of being labeled as "crazy" or being discriminated against in their personal and professional lives. This stigma around mental health has resulted in a significant underestimation of the prevalence of mental illness in Asia and a lack of resources to support those in need.

## ðŸ’¼ What it does
ColorfulCare is a mental health app that provides a safe and inclusive space for minority individuals to connect, share experiences, and find support. Our app connects users from different ethnicities, religions, sexualities, and genders to group chats where they can discuss their mental health concerns and receive support from others who understand their experiences.

#Features#
**Group Chats**: Our app provides access to group chats where users can connect with others who share their experiences and receive support for their mental health concerns.

**Local Group Meetings**: We help users find local group mental health meetings based on their zip code, enabling them to connect with others in their community.

**Informative Resources**: Our app provides informative articles and resources to help users better understand and manage their mental health.

**Safe and Inclusive Space**: Our goal is to provide a welcoming and inclusive space for individuals from all backgrounds to find support and promote positive mental health, and to ultimately mitigate the stigma surrounding mental health in minority communities.

## ðŸ”¨ How we built it
We began by creating a prototype on Figma, and then we used our design to develop a couple static pages such as the login page and the landing page using HTML and CSS.

## ðŸ““ What we learned
Creating ColorfulCare has been a tremendous learning experience. From using Figma to prototype the app professionally, to developing an efficient process to iterate on ideas, the project has been a valuable opportunity to hone our skills. Collaborating with a diverse team, we have learned to leverage each of our strengths to achieve our goals. ColorfulCare has taught us the importance of leveraging technology for a greater cause, and how powerful it can be to bring people together around important issues.

## ðŸ”® What's next for ColorfulCare

**Google Firebase Integration**: We are currently working on integrating Google Firebase to enable authentication and add additional user verification features, as well as to provide an enhanced user experience.

**AI Integration**: We plan to integrate AI to generate prompts for group chats to foster deeper conversations and enhance the overall user experience.

**Web Application Platform**: In addition to the mobile application version, we also plan to create a web application platform to appeal to a larger audience.

**Larger Groups**: We plan to introduce larger groups of 100+ people for larger, more far-reaching events to expand our user base and increase our impact in the mental health space.
